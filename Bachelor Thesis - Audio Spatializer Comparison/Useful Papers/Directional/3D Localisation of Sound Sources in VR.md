# Test Approach:

- Enviroment: empty, light grey room
- Participant has to pinpoint the position of the virtual sound source using a laser pointer
- Audio sources are invisible to combat bias
- Room as simple as possible to reduce distraction
- Easy localization if sounds are familiar -> well known sound
- before Evaluation -> Tutorial
- Participant can move in a small area
- Source positions: 216 positions (near field, mid field, far field) -> evenly scattered
- Procedure:
	- Only one participant
	- Tutorial at first
	- A round consists of one sound playing + pin pointing
	- 54 sessions with 24 selections
- Data collection:
	- Total of 1200 data points
	- Friedman test for significant differences
	- p-value = 0.44 -> no difference
	- Far field yields a p-value of 0.002
	- Learning curve: stays the same
	-
