This part of the comparison should determine the accuracy of the spatializers for different <span class="purple">bands</span> of the spectrum.

The bands are 
- LOW (20 - 250)
- MID  (250 - 4kHz)
- HIGH (4kHz - 20kHz)

During each round a spatializer plays an audio file in these bands from a random direction.



Procedure:
- Small Tutorial on how to use the Laser
- Tell the participant to step on the marking on the floor and look forward
- Start Round:
	- Pick a spatializer, audio cue and position
	- Play the cues 3 times in a span of 2 seconds
	- Participant can turn and points in the direction
	- Evaluate (not shown)
	- Restart until all rounds are done



The Paper [[EMPTY - 3D Localisation of Sound Sources in VR]] does a similar approach using random positions ranging from near- to mid- to far-field. The proposed approach also uses a virtual laser pointer on a controller to point to the guessed point. To determine the distance of the source the participant uses the thumb stick to change the ray length.

The paper  [[EMPTY - The Effect of Audio-Visual Room Divergence on the Localization of Real Sound Sources in VR]] uses a different approach to pinpoint the position of the source:
After hearing the audio cue the participant moves a virtual agent until it fits the guessed position.

The paper [[EMPTY - Static and dynamic sound source localization in a virtual room]] also uses a controller with an attached ray to point in the guessed direction. It proposes the use of different stimuli with different frequency contents to test how frequency affect the ability to accurately guess the direction.

The paper [[EMPTY - Localization of real and virtual sound sources]] proposes the approach to add the use of real speakers to obtain a real reference to the virtual spatializers.

The paper [[EMPTY - Comparison of headphones and equalization for virtual auditory source localization]] conducts the comparison of different headphones using the localization of sound sources. It proposes hand pointing as the primary way to point in the direction of the guessed source.
